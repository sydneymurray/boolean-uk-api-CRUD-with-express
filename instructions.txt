Today's exercise: Create with Express

Repo: boolean-uk-api-create-with-express

Description
Build the router and the createOne controller for the Books and Pets database

Instructions
- Use this starter template: https://codesandbox.io/s/1001-express-and-sql-create-fbd7v?file=/src/index.js
- Replace the PGURL environment variable with the your database URL found:
    -- in ElephantSQL
    -- in the details section.
- Build the router for the Books resource
- Build the router for the Pets resource
- Build the createOne controller for the Books resource
- Build the createOne controller for the Pets resource

Tips
- Take a look inside the model to see what data types you are working with.
- Use ElephantSQL to check if your requests are succesfully creating rows in the database (there will be mockData stored in there already).

Challenge 1
- Add validation in your controller that sends a useful message back to the client when there's an error, with suggestions as to what they could do differently.

Challenge 2
- Have a look inside utils/mockData.js and see if you can generate some mock data and build your own resource and model ie. a bank account resource or a vehicle tax resource. Take a look at faker.js for inspiration.
